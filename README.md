Nice to meet you, my name is Houwou.
I am not an engineer, just a medical laboratory scientist.
I started programming as a hobby, and now I do a little bit of application development to improve my work.
I mainly use Python as my development language, but I also study C# and Dart without boundaries.
I work on desktop applications, web applications, microcontrollers, AI development and any other technology available.
I would like to borrow your knowledge.
